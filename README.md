# The Game of Mao
The game of Mao is a game of rules

The goal of Mao is to get rid of all of your cards

## Setup
The game is for 2-10 players.

One player is chosen as the dealer. Every player is dealt seven cards and they face down. The rest of the cards are placed in a Draw Pile face down. Next to the pile, a space should be designated for a Discard pile. The top card should be placed in the Discard Pile. If any player touches their cards before the game has started, they are penalized (see more information in the Penalties section).

When the dealer has announced the direction of play and announced "The Game of Mao has begun" all players pick up their cards 

All players can enforce the rules of Mao.

## Rules of play
Every player views his/her cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.

You have to match either by the number or suit of the card. For example, if the discard pile has a 5 of hearts, any 5 or card with hearts can be played. (UNO rules)

If a player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards even though they might have a match, they must draw from the Draw pile. If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, keep the card, and the game moves on to the next player in turn.

## Penalties:
The heard of Mao lies in its dynamic Rules and avoiding the penalties for breaking them. Any time a player breaks one of the rules, it is up to the other players to catch it. They must then say "penalty for", followed by an explanation of the action that broke the rule (but not necessarily the rule itself). The player must then take one card as their penalty.

## Point of Order
A player may call "Point of order" at any point during the game. All players must immediately put their hand down; you may not touch any cards besides the draw stack and discard pile. During a Point of Order, all verbal rules are suspended (unless specified otherise). Questions may be asked, but the Rules of Mao may not be explained. A Point of Order may only be ended by the person that started it saying "end point of order".

## Winning the game
To win a game of Mao, a player must play their last card without breaking any rules doing so.  When the play their card, they must say Mao, unless the card is a Jack, in which case they must say "Mao Mao". If they fail to do this, or break ano other rules during the play, they must draw one card, take back their 'winning' card, and end their turn.

## Rules
### General Rules
- Any time you recieve a penalty, you must thank the player that gave it to you.
- Players may not ask ANY questions
- Players can trigger a Point of Order by saying "point of order". See Point of Order for more details.
- Players must announce "one card" any time their hand dwindles to one card.
- Saying the word "Mao" while a game is in progress results in a FIVE card penalty.

### Card Specific Rules
- Ace's skip the next player's turn.
- 2's let you play again IF you have another card to play. Drawing is not an option.
- 7's cause the next player to draw two cards and lose their turn. The player who draws the two cards must also say "Have a nice day". The player who draws the two cards may instead play another 7 to "stack it" pass the cumulative burden on to the next player.
- 8's reverse the direction of play.
- Jack's are wildcards. The suit must be called before the card is played. The player may not change their mind. Playing a Jack on top of a Jack is forbidden and results in a THREE card penalty; the player loses their turn and the jack is discarded.
