## Rules of play
Every player views his/her cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.

You have to match either by the number or suit of the card. For example, if the discard pile has a 5 of hearts, any 5 or card with hearts can be played. (UNO rules)

If a player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards even though they might have a match, they must draw from the Draw pile. If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, keep the card, and the game moves on to the next player in turn.
