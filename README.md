# The Game of Mao
The game of Mao is a game of rules

The goal of Mao is to get rid of all of your cards

## Setup
The game is for 2-10 players.

One player is chosen as the dealer. Every player is dealt seven cards and they face down. The rest of the cards are placed in a Draw Pile face down. Next to the pile, a space should be designated for a Discard pile. The top card should be placed in the Discard Pile. If any player touches their cards before the game has started, they are penalized (see more information in the Penalties section).

When the dealer has announced the direction of play and announced "The Game of Mao has begun" all players pick up their cards 

## Basic Gameplay
The rules of Mao outlined in **Rules** must be followed at all times. All players can enforce the rules of Mao.

Every player views his/her cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.

You have to match either by the number or suit of the card. For example, if the discard pile has a 5 of hearts, any 5 or card with hearts can be played. (UNO rules)

If a player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards even though they might have a match, they must draw from the Draw pile. If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, keep the card, and the game moves on to the next player in turn.

## Penalties:
The heard of Mao lies in its dynamic Rules and avoiding the penalties for breaking them. Any time a player breaks one of the rules, it is up to the other players to catch it. They must then say "penalty for", followed by an explanation of the action that broke the rule (but not necessarily the rule itself). The player must then take one card as their penalty.
### Giving penalites
Whenever a rule is broken, the player is penalized by being given one card from the draw pile. Any player can administer a penalty card, and upon giving the card, they must state what the penalized play has done to deserve the card.

Some Examples include:

*Suzy plays a seven, but forgets to say "Have a nice day." You give her one card and say, “Failure to say ‘have a nice day.’”*
### Bad Calls
If a player penalizes you improperly, you may give that player the penalty card the just gave you and one additional penalty card and say "bad call".

## Point of Order
A player may call "Point of order" at any point during the game. All players must immediately put their hand down; you may not touch any cards besides the draw stack and discard pile. During a Point of Order, all verbal rules are suspended (unless specified otherise). Questions may be asked, but the Rules of Mao may not be explained. A Point of Order may only be ended by the person that started it saying "end point of order".

## Winning the game
To win a game of Mao, a player must play their last card without breaking any rules doing so.  When the play their card, they must say Mao, unless the card is a Jack, in which case they must say "Mao Mao". If they fail to do this, or break ano other rules during the play, they must draw one card, take back their 'winning' card, and end their turn.

## Rules
### General Rules
- Any time you recieve a penalty, you must thank the player that gave it to you.
- Players may not ask ANY questions
- Players can trigger a Point of Order by saying "point of order". See Point of Order for more details.
- Players must announce "one card" any time their hand dwindles to one card.
- Saying the word "Mao" while a game is in progress results in a FIVE card penalty.
- Saying "point of order" during a Point of Order is forbidden. Explained by saying "Saying P of O during a P of O"
- After the game has finished and "Mao" has been said, the winner of the game gets to make up one new rule for the next time the game is played. It is not told to the players during gameplay.

### Card Specific Rules
- When a player plays a spade, the player must announce "__ of Spades" where "__" is the card name.
- Ace's skip the next player's turn.
- 2's let you play again IF you have another card to play. Drawing is not an option.
- If a 7 is played, the player must say "Have a nice day," and the next player must either draw two cards or play another seven and say "Have a very nice day." If multiple sevens are played in a row, the player of each seven must add one "very" to the phrase "Have a very nice day," and when a player is unable to play a seven, they must draw two cards for each seven played before their turn. This concludes the players turn.
- 8's reverse the direction of play.
- Jack's are wildcards. The suit must be called before the card is played. The player may not change their mind. Playing a Jack on top of a Jack is forbidden and results in a THREE card penalty; the player loses their turn and the jack is discarded.
